# pkepley.github.io

This is a repository for my personal Github page / Web-page.

This styling page is a fork of the
[Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme for
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

I have fiddled a bit with the layouts and theming, but not much has
been changed from vanilla Minima. In particular, I have added support
for displaying tags and changed the newer post / older post footer
links.
