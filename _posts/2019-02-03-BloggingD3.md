It's about that time of year where I start thinking about how to make
 interactive plots / simple dashboards again... In that spirit, I've
 started playing around with D3 again, and I spent the better part of
 the weekend making a simple visualization of a pawn's tour around the
 Monopoly gameboard. My goal was to plot the pawn's movement while
 simultaneously estimating and displaying an empirical long-run
 occupancy distribution of the squares the pawn visits. For the most
 part, I got the simulation and display working, but it's still a bit
 of a work in progress.

In the mean-time, I thought it would be fun to mimic some plots in the
spirit of <a href = "https://fred.stlouisfed.org">FRED</a>. The
following chart shows the FHFA all-transactions housing price index
(blue line), with recessionary periods (based on a GDP-based recession
indicator) displayed in grey.
