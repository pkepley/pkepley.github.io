After having not-blogged prior to this point, I have decided that I
would like to periodically maintain a quasi-technical blog. The n-fold
purpose of this blog is to:

* Serve as a repository for ideas and notes
* Provide a snapshot of what I think is interesting at a given point in time
* Show-case what I am working on
* Force me to write more... 

Probably the most important point listed here is actually the last
one. Over the past few years I have spent a lot of time writing with a
purely technical audience in mind. What I would like to do here is to
attempt to summarize some ideas in a slightly less technical
format. 

Also, I would like to have a space which I can use to show off cool
visualizations / images related to what I think is interesting / what
I am working on. 

The focus of posts here will probably be related to basic machine
learning and data analysis. These are things I have been intrigued by
for quite some time. However, I have only recently begun to look into
these topics with any amount of seriousness.  I will also put up some
posts related to my research (since I have spent huge amounts of time
on these things, and I think there are some pretty cool pictures
related to my results).
