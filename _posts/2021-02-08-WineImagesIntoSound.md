title: Turning Wine Images Into Sound
---

In this post, I follow a procedure from a recent episode of
Computerphile to convert some waveform images back into audio. In
particular, I turn a wine bottle's label back into the sound that
created it...  with unsurprisingly mediocre results! ðŸ™‚

## Background
Back in 2017, I was looking for a bottle of wine at my local
Jewel-Osco when I ran across one called "Urlo (Scream)." I hadn't heard
of this wine before, but its label stuck out to me because it seemed
to show a graphical representation of a scream:

<img src="{{img_path}}/urlo-scream.jpg" height=500/> 

I thought it might be fun to try to undo the encoding process and turn
the picture back into the sound that created it. So, I snapped a
picture of the bottle and carried on with my shopping. (I didn't end
up buying the wine, I just thought its label looked interesting!)  In
the end, I must have forgotten about the photo that I took, since I
didn't end up doing anything with the picture at the time. That
probably would have been the end of this idea, if I hadn't run across
the following recent Computerphile video:

<div style="margin-top:25px; margin-bottom:25px;">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQOdmckqNro" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%;"></iframe>
</div>

In this video, they managed to get a fairly faithful reconstruction of
an audio signal from a waveform image which they made while editing
some audio for a Computerphile video. Their reconstruction procedure
is simple and explained fairly thoroughly in the video, so I couldn't
resist implementing it in Python.  As a sanity check (since I knew it
worked pretty well for them), I ran my implementation against the same
image that they used in the Computerphile video. The results for this
image, as in the video, were pretty good. Knowing that my
implementation worked (more or less), I went back and applied it to my
wine bottle image, and I got pretty mediocre results!

For the remainder the post, I'll provide a brief description of their
algorithm ([here](#reconstruction_procedure)), my sanity check against
the Computerphile image ([here](#computerphile_reconstruction)), and
the results for the wine bottle reconstruction
([here](#wine_reconstruction)). 

In case you'd like to have a look at the scripts which were used to
generate the results in this post, my code can be obtained
[here](https://github.com/pkepley/blog-notebooks/tree/master/20210208_TheScream).

## Reconstruction Procedure <a id="reconstruction_procedure"></a>
To reconstruct the signal, you first need to throw away anything in
the image that doesn't correspond to the waveform (i.e. crop away
everything except for the signal). Next you need to reduce the image
to a contrast between a signal and background (i.e. threshold the
image). Once this has been done, you can scan along each vertical line
(corresponding to a temporal sample) to find the upper and lower
bounds of the pixels that belong to the signal. These time series for
the upper and lower bounds can then be interleaved (i.e. every other
sample comes from the upper or lower series) to form a signal with
twice the number of samples as the original image. This interleaving
procedure introduces a high-frequency ringing into the reconstruction,
so the signal needs to be smoothed a bit to remove high-frequency
artifacts (this was done using a simple moving average). Finally, the
signal needs to be up-sampled in order to produce a signal with a
reasonable duration (this was accomplished through linear
interpolation).

Note: I'm not entirely sure why they chose to interleave the upper and
lower bound signals, since this ends up forcing you to take a moving
average of the signal. Once you do the moving average, you're
basically just taking the average of the upper and lower bound
series. So, instead of interleaving, you could probably just take the
average of the two bounds in each sample. If you did it this way, you
*might* not have to smooth the signal to remove the ringing
artifacts - but it may still be necessary!

## Sanity Checking With the Computerphile Audio <a id="computerphile_reconstruction"></a>

To begin with, let's have a look at the original image used in the
Computerphile video: 

<img src="{{img_path}}/computerphile.png"/>

As you can see, this image is pretty high quality, and doesn't seem to
be "missing" too much of the original signal.

After manually cropping the image in Numpy, I recovered the
following signal envelope: 

<img src="{{img_path}}/computerphile_extraction.png"/>

Applying the procedure described above resulted in the following audio:

<audio controls id="region_hpi_audio" preload="auto">
<source src="{{ audio_path }}/computerphile.wav" type="audio/wav"/>
Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
</audio>

Although the audio speaks for itself (literally!), and demonstrates a
reasonable recovery of the original signal, I also threw the `.wav`
file into Audacity to have a look at the signal I recovered. Here's
what the recovered waveform looks like in Audacity:

<img src="{{img_path}}/computerphile_audacity.png"/>

At this point, we've gone full circle... we've taken a waveform image,
turned it back into audio, and then generated a new wave form image
from the reconstruction. What if we kept on going with this process? I
guess we *could* repeat this process indefinitely in order to produce
progressively worse audio... I just didn't have the motivation to do
that today. ðŸ™‚

## Reconstructing the Wine Scream <a id="wine_reconstruction"></a>

Before feeding the wine image into my recovery program, I did a bit of
pre-processing in GIMP. In particular, I rotated the image, tried to
undo a bit of distortion from the shot's closeness / angle (although I
didn't attempt to remove the wine bottle's curvature), converted the
image to black-and-white, and cropped some extraneous junk from the
image. After that, I was left with the following result:

<img src="{{img_path}}/thresh.jpg" height=400/>

Feeding this image into my program resulted in the following signal
envelope:

<img src="{{img_path}}/wine_extraction.png" height=400/>

From here, I had to play a bit with the stretching factor to pick an
appropriate signal duration, but after that was done I obtained the
following audio:

<audio controls id="region_hpi_audio" preload="auto">
<source src="{{ audio_path }}/wine.wav" type="audio/wav"/>
Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
</audio>

As I've said above, the result is *not* great. However, the following
screen capture from Audacity shows that the recovered waveform mostly
looks like the image that I started with:

<img src="{{img_path}}/wine_audacity.png" height=300/>

The main reason that this audio is so much worse than the
Computerphile audio, is probably a result of the *way* that the two
images were created. The Computerphile image was created in
high-resolution from a computer screen capture of a similar program to
Audacity. As a result, this image has *most* of the acoustic signal
present in it with only a bit of loss due to digitization. On the
other hand, the scream signal was inked onto a wine bottle label. The
result of that process is a *very* lossy encoding that almost
certainly removed the bulk of the signal's high-frequency content.
This is especially problematic for a signal like a scream, since it
should almost certainly have non-trivial components in the higher
pitch ranges!  In addition, the wine bottle had a substantial
curvature that I didn't bother to adjust for, which further distorted
the reconstructed signal.

Even though the results were kind of disappointing (although I should
have expected as much), I'm happy to at least have a vague idea of
what the wine bottle's scream might have sounded like.
