In this post, I describe my (lazy) solution to FiveThirtyEight's most recent
[Riddler
Problem](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-navigate-the-one-way-streets/).
This problem asks us to imagine living in a city which has a square gridded
network of one-way streets whose orientations were assigned completely at
random. Supposing that you live in the upper left corner of the city and work in
the lower right corner, we're asked: How likely is it that you can navigate from
your home to work via the city's street network?

The original prompt asked us to consider a square city two blocks across by two
blocks high, however I chose to approach the problem more generally, considering
square cities with an arbitrary width. As usual for these sorts of problems, I
approached the problem from two directions, coming up with an exact analytical
solution, and then estimating the result by simulation. 

Unfortunately, I couldn't think of an elegant exact solution... so I resorted to
a brute force approach, simply enumerating all possible city layouts and
counting the fraction with a navigable path from home to work. The brute force
nature of my exact approach meant that I could only consider relatively small
cities. In fact, letting $$n$$ denote the number of intersections across the
city (i.e. one more than the number of city blocks!), I was only able to "solve"
the problem for $$n = 2,3,4$$. But, because this range included the $$n = 3$$
case discussed in the prompt, I decided to call it quits for exact methods after
that ðŸ™‚ 

More interestingly, for cities of size $$n = 2, \ldots, 20$$, I estimated the
probability that you could navigate by simulating random street assignments and
counting the fraction that had a navigable path from home to work. In principle,
this approach would have worked for *any* city size, but I figured $$20$$ was
big enough.

As usual, I've made the script for my solution available, and you download the
solution script (in Julia) <a href="{{ asset_path
}}/random_networks.jl">here.</a> This time, I wrote my solution as a [Pluto
notebook](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl), which I've rendered statically for
viewing <a href="{{ asset_path }}/random_networks.jl.html">here</a>.

## Simulation Solution
To begin with, lets take a look at a couple realizations of random street
assignments for the $$2 \times 2$$ block / $$n = 3$$ case. In the first example,
there is no path from home (labeled $$1$$) to work (labeled $$9$$). In the
second example, you can get to work using the path `1 => 2 => 5 => 8 => 9`.
Unfortunately, although you can get to work in this city, there isn't any way
for you to get back home!

        <img src="{{ asset_path }}/street_layout_example_2.png" width="250px">
    </center> 
</div>

For each random street assignment, I determined whether there was a path from
home to work by constructing a directed graph from the street assignment using
[LightGraphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl). From there, I
determined whether the network had a path from home to work using the very aptly
named `has_path` function.

For each city size $$n = 2, 3, \ldots, 20$$, I generated one million random
street assignments and determined the fraction which had a navigable path from
home to work. The results are summarized in the following figure.

The following table summarizes the results for small $$n$$, but you can obtain
the complete output data set [here]("{{ asset_path }}/prob_path_sim_rslts.csv").

|City Width | Probability Navigable |
| 2         | 0.437285              |
| 3         | 0.276792              |
| 4         | 0.198974              |

So, we see that the solution for $$n = 3$$ is around $$27.7\%$$.

## (Lazy) Exact Solution for Small Cities

As I mentioned in the introduction, I couldn't think of a *good* analytical
solution to this problem, so I decided to implement a *bad* solution - i.e. I
just brute forced the answer. If the problem had asked for a slightly larger
city, say a $$ 4 \times 4 $$ grid (i.e. $$n = 5$$) then this approach would
*not* have been feasible. However, for cities of size $$n = 2,3,4$$ there are
only $$2^4, 2^{12}$$, and $$2^{24} = 16,777,216$$ street layouts respectively[^1].

To perform the computation, I followed largely the same steps that I discussed
in the previous section. The only difference here, was that I looped over all
possible street layouts instead of generating them at random. 

The following table shows the results:

| City Size | Probability Navigable                       |
| 2         | $$ 7 /  16 \approx 0.4375 $$                |
| 3         | $$ 1,135 / 4,096 \approx 0.27588 $$         |
| 4         | $$ 3,329,245 / 16,777,216  \approx 0.19802$$|

From the table, we see that for a $$2\times2$$ city (i.e. $$n = 3$$) there's
about a $$27.7\%$$ chance that we'll be able to drive to work!


## Footnotes
[^1]: To see this, first draw out the cities and convince yourself that cities
    of these sizes respectively have a total of $$4, 12$$ and $$24$$ streets.
    From there, note that, because each street can be in one of two directions
    there are $$2^{n_\text{streets}}$$ possible layouts for any city.
