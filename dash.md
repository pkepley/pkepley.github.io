Here are a few dashboards I have been maintaining:

- <u><a href ="https://storage.googleapis.com/paulkepley.com/c19-dash-v2/index.html">Covid-19 Dashboard</a></u>: This 
  dashboard replaces an earlier dashboard that I created in the early days of the pandemic to 
  help me keep track of the regional spread of Covid-19 in the United
  States. The data is still being refreshed, and is sourced nightly from the [JHU CSSE COVID-19 repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), processed locally and then uploaded to Google storage by a process running on a a Raspberry Pi 4b. Graphics are rendered client-side using D3.js. The git repository for this project may be [found here](https://github.com/pkepley/c19-dash-v2/).
  
  The repository for the predecessor to this dashboard can be [found here](https://github.com/pkepley/c19-dash/).

<!-- - <u><a href = "https://www.paulkepley.com/weather-app">Weather Forecast Accuracy Dashboard</a></u>: This dashboard -->
<!--   resulted from a series of lunch conversations about the weather. The -->
<!--   data for this dashboard is sourced nightly from the NWS websiste and -->
<!--   inserted into a simple SQLite database. Data are served to the user -->
<!--   via Flask, and rendered client side via D3. The git repository for this project may be [found here](https://github.com/pkepley/weather-flask-app). -->
