Hi, I'm Paul. The main purpose of this blog is to serve as a
repository for random projects that I'm playing around with.

Here are some things you might want to know about me:

- A couple of years back, I graduated with a PhD in mathematics from [Purdue University](http://math.purdue.edu), and I did my undergrad studies in math & physics at [Washington University in St. Louis](http://www.wustl.edu).
- My graduate research focused on some topics related to the inverse boundary value problem for the wave equation (arXiv drafts of my publications can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03397), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02383), and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02749)).
- I really enjoy programming in both Python and R, but I've recently been playing around with Julia a lot more.
- I enjoy solving problems. I'm a pretty big fan of FiveThirtyEight's [Riddler problems](https://fivethirtyeight.com/?s=riddler), and I've also really enjoyed the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) the last couple years. I solved a bunch of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, but I haven't really solved them for a few years (regardless, here's [my completion stats](https://projecteuler.net/profile/pkepley.png)).
- I dabble in the banjo and guitar.
