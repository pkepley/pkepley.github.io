My name is Paul Kepley, and the main purpose of this blog is to serve
as a repository for notes with a focus on what I'm reading / learning
about. Also, I'll probably work through some puzzle problems every now
and then.

Here are some things you might want to know about me:

- I recently(ish) graduated with a PhD in Mathematics from [Purdue University](http://math.purdue.edu), and I did my undergrad studies at [Washington University in St. Louis](http://www.wustl.edu).
- My graduate research focused on some topics related to the inverse boundary value problem for the wave equation.
- I really enjoy programming in both Python and R. The Tidyverse (especially pipelining functions and ggplot2) have been very useful paradigms.
- I dabble in the banjo and guitar.
- I enjoy solving problems. I'm a pretty big fan of FiveThirtyEight's Riddler problems. I've really enjoyed the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) the last couple years, and will occasionally play around with [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.
